# Articulate Platform Code Challenge

The Platform team manages internal tools for the engineering team at Articulate.
One thing we need to do from time to time is share secrets with each other (API
keys, etc).

You will find the scaffolding of a Go, Python, or JavaScript web app. Pick one to
work with and complete this application following the guidelines below. Feel free
to delete the files you don't need.

## Requirements

* When the secret is submitted, I should see a URL that I can visit to retrieve
  the same secret.
* I should only be able to retrieve the secret once.
* The secret should not be stored in plain text.
* The application and any dependent services should be ran inside containers (Docker).
* You should provide instructions to run the application locally in your Pull Request.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to see a working example (with a few more features), you can check
> out our implementation called [Shush/Yopass](https://shush.articulate.com/).

Out of scope:

* The application does not need to look pretty or match the provided styling. Focus
  on meeting the above requirements.

## Expectations

* Do not spend more than 3-4 hours on this challenge. We care more about your
  approach, communication, and thoughts more than ticking technical boxes.
* You have one week to complete this challenge. We understand you have commitments
  outside of interviewing. We want you to set aside a time that works for you to
  complete this, let us know if something comes up.
* Once you have completed the challenge, open a Pull Request with your solution.
  * The pull request should have a proper title and description.
  * The pull request should have instructions on how to run the application locally.
* Comment on code inside the pull request itself to add questions that you ran
  into or assumptions you made while completing this challenge. You can also push
  up a Draft PR and ask us questions in Slack as you work through the challenge.
